Tutorials
=========

A series of random tutorials I wrote for my less technical work colleagues containing basic information and occasional handy tips on various subjects relevant to our work.

The aim for these tutorials are to be:

- extremely short (because who has time to learn boring stuff, when you could be doing statistics instead!?)
- immediately practical (mostly)
- (hopefully) clear and easy to read/follow/understand... no promises though!
